## Systemic Risk Classification

### Article 51 criteria:

| Path | Criterion | Threshold |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Automatic presumption | Cumulative training compute | >10^25 FLOPs |
| Commission designation | High-impact capabilities or equivalent | Annex XIII criteria: parameters; dataset quality or size; training compute; input/output modalities; benchmarks and evaluations, including autonomy, scalability and access to tools; internal-market reach; and registered end-users |

### Contesting the presumption:
The Code of Practice notes that the Commission should establish "a rapid and reliable mechanism for model providers to contest the systemic risk presumption" for models exceeding 10^25 FLOPs. The Commission is also exploring thresholds based on capability-related factors rather than compute alone.

### Classification evidence:
Do not infer systemic-risk status from a brand or model family. Confirm the documented cumulative training compute or a Commission designation under Article 51 and record the evidence used.

## Commitment 1: Safety & Security Framework

### Purpose:
Outline the systemic risk management processes and measures to ensure risks are acceptable.

### Measure 1.1: Creating the Framework
- Develop a state-of-the-art Safety & Security Framework **before** model release
- Framework must specify:
  - Evaluation triggers (when assessments are required)
  - Risk categories covered
  - Mitigation strategy approach
  - Forecasting methods for emerging risks
  - Organisational responsibilities

### Measure 1.2: Implementing the Framework
- Operationalise the Framework across the organisation
- Ensure all relevant teams understand and follow Framework procedures
- Integrate Framework into development and deployment workflows

### Measure 1.3: Updating the Framework
- Regular review and updates in response to:
  - New systemic risks identified
  - Serious incidents
  - Significant changes to model or deployment environment
  - Advances in safety evaluation methodologies
  - Regulatory guidance or standards developments

### Measure 1.4: Framework Notifications
- **Notify the AI Office** of the Framework
- Keep notification current with material changes

---

## Commitment 2: Systemic Risk Identification

### Measure 2.1: Systemic Risk Identification Process
- Follow a **structured process** to identify systemic risks:
  - Maintain a risk inventory
  - Conduct regular horizon scanning
  - Consult internal experts (safety, security, policy, domain experts)
  - Consult external experts (academia, civil society, downstream users)
  - Review reports on similar models and emerging threats

### Measure 2.2: Systemic Risk Scenarios
- Develop **concrete risk scenarios** for each identified risk:
  - Describe the causal chain from model capability to potential harm
  - Assess plausibility and severity
  - Identify affected populations and systems
  - Consider both intentional misuse and unintended consequences
  - Include scenarios for novel, unprecedented risks

---

## Commitment 3: Systemic Risk Analysis

Five analysis elements (may overlap and be applied recursively):

### Measure 3.1: Model-Independent Information
- Gather contextual information not specific to the model:
  - Threat landscape and adversary capabilities
  - Societal vulnerabilities
  - Regulatory environment
  - Existing protective infrastructure

### Measure 3.2: Model Evaluations
- Conduct state-of-the-art evaluations using standardised protocols:
  - **Adversarial testing** (red-teaming) to identify vulnerabilities
  - Capability evaluations against safety benchmarks
  - Stress testing under edge-case conditions
  - Third-party/independent evaluations where feasible
- Document all evaluation methodologies, results, and limitations

### Measure 3.3: Systemic Risk Modelling
- Model the potential systemic impact:
  - Propagation pathways
  - Interaction with other systems and societal structures
  - Scaling effects
  - Cascading failure scenarios

### Measure 3.4: Systemic Risk Estimation
- Estimate severity and likelihood for each identified risk:
  - Quantitative methods where feasible
  - Expert judgment and structured elicitation where quantification is not possible
  - Document confidence levels and uncertainty ranges

### Measure 3.5: Post-Market Monitoring
- **Continuous monitoring** after model deployment:
  - Track real-world use patterns and incidents
  - Monitor for capability discoveries and novel misuse vectors
  - Update risk assessments based on post-market evidence
  - Engage with user community for early warning signals

---

## Commitment 4: Risk Acceptance Determination

### Measure 4.1: Risk Acceptance Criteria
- **Define explicit acceptance criteria** before deployment:
  - Risk-tier framework (e.g., acceptable / conditional / unacceptable)
  - **Built-in safety margins** — criteria should not be at the exact boundary of acceptable risk
  - Criteria should cover both individual risks and aggregate risk profile
  - Regular review and update of criteria

### Measure 4.2: Proceed/Stop Decision
- Based on risk acceptance determination, decide whether to:
  - **Proceed** with development, market placement, or continued deployment
  - **Proceed with conditions** (additional mitigations, restricted access)
  - **Stop** — do not release or withdraw from market
- If risks are deemed **unacceptable**, immediate corrective action required
- Document the decision, reasoning, and any conditions applied

---

## Commitment 5: Safety Mitigations

Implement appropriate safety measures **throughout the entire model lifecycle**:

### Categories of safety mitigations:
- **Pre-deployment:** Alignment training, RLHF, refusal training, content filtering
- **Deployment controls:** Phased access, rate limiting, monitoring, usage policies
- **Output safeguards:** Filtering, watermarking, content classification
- **Downstream safeguards:** Guidance and tools for downstream providers/deployers
- **Ongoing:** Continuous monitoring, rapid response capabilities, model updates

### Lifecycle coverage:
- Training and development
- Pre-release evaluation
- Initial deployment
- Ongoing operation
- Model updates and fine-tuning
- End-of-life and decommissioning

---

## Commitment 6: Security Mitigations

Implement adequate cybersecurity protection for models and physical infrastructure.

### Exemption:
A model is **exempt** from this Commitment if its capabilities are inferior to at least one model whose parameters are publicly available for download.

### Security measures apply until:
- Model parameters are made publicly available for download, OR
- Model is securely deleted

### Required protections (aligned with Appendix 4):

#### Digital security:
- Access controls for model weights and training infrastructure
- Encryption of model assets at rest and in transit
- Secure development lifecycle
- Vulnerability management and patching
- Penetration testing and security audits

#### Physical security:
- Physical access controls for data centres and training infrastructure
- Environmental controls
- Hardware security for model-serving infrastructure

#### Operational security:
- Insider threat controls
- Security monitoring and logging
- Incident response procedures
- Supply chain security for training data and infrastructure

#### Model-specific security:
- Protection against model extraction attacks
- Adversarial robustness measures
- Secure API design and rate limiting

---

## Commitment 7: Model Reports

### Pre-market report to AI Office:

#### Measure 7.1: Model Description and Behaviour
- Architecture, capabilities, intended use
- Known limitations and failure modes

#### Measure 7.2: Reasons for Proceeding
- Reasons supporting the decision to proceed with development, market placement, or use
- Conditions and assumptions on which the decision depends

#### Measure 7.3: Documentation of Systemic Risk Identification, Analysis, and Mitigation
- Identified risks and scenarios, evaluation and analysis results, and implemented mitigations
- Confidence levels, methods, limitations, and residual-risk conclusions

#### Measure 7.4: External Reports
- Include or reference relevant external evaluations, assessments, and reports
- Explain how external findings were addressed

#### Measure 7.5: Material Changes to the Systemic Risk Landscape
- Any changes since previous reports
- Emerging risks or new information

#### Measure 7.6: Model Report Updates
- Keep Model Report **up-to-date** throughout model lifecycle

- Give the AI Office access to the current Model Report and notify required updates

### Practical notes:
- May reference other reports/notifications already provided to AI Office
- May create single report for multiple related models if risk assessment is interconnected
- **SME/SMC accommodation:** May reduce detail level proportionate to size and capacity constraints

---

## Commitment 8: Responsibility Allocation

### Measure 8.1: Clear Responsibilities
- Define responsibilities for systemic risk management **across all organisational levels**:
  - **Board/executive level:** Oversight and strategic direction
  - **Management level:** Risk ownership and resource allocation
  - **Operational level:** Day-to-day monitoring and response
  - **Assurance level:** Independent review and audit

### Measure 8.2: Appropriate Resources

---

## Commitment 9: Serious Incident Reporting

### Requirements:
- **Track and document** serious incidents throughout the model lifecycle
- **Report to AI Office** (and national competent authorities as applicable)
- **Without undue delay** — specific deadlines apply based on severity:
  - Incidents affecting **critical infrastructure:** Report within **2 days**
  - Other serious incidents: Report promptly, with initial notification followed by detailed report
- Reports must include:
  - Incident description and timeline
  - Model involvement assessment
  - Impact assessment (actual and potential)
  - Corrective measures taken or planned
- **Report updates:** Provide updates as new information becomes available
- **Retention:** Keep incident records for at least **5 years**
- **Resourcing:** Proportionate to severity and degree of model involvement

### What constitutes a "serious incident":
- Incidents resulting in death or serious damage to health, property, or environment
- Serious and irreversible disruption of critical infrastructure
- Serious breaches of fundamental rights
- Significant security incidents (model theft, unauthorised access with impact)

---

## Commitment 10: Additional Documentation

### Measure 10.1: Documentation
- Retain detailed records of all safety and risk management activities
- **Minimum retention:** 10 years
- Records must be sufficient to demonstrate compliance

### Measure 10.2: Public Transparency
- **Publish summarised versions** of Framework and Model Reports when necessary to reduce risks
- Exception: Publication not required if the model qualifies as "similarly safe or safer" (see Appendix 2)
- Summaries should be meaningful without compromising security-sensitive information

---

## Risk Categories (Appendix 1)

Appendix 1.1 defines five types of risks for structured identification:

1. risks to public health,
2. risks to safety,
3. risks to public security,
4. risks to fundamental rights, and
5. risks to society as a whole.

Appendix 1.4 separately specifies four systemic risks: chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear risks; loss of control; cyber offence; and harmful manipulation.

Other risks listed in the Code, such as major accidents, critical infrastructure, discrimination, privacy, the environment, democratic processes, concentration of power, and illegal or harmful content, are examples or contributing risks within the five Appendix 1.1 types. They are not additional official top-level categories.

## Practical Compliance Steps

### If You Can Only Do Three Things First

The Safety & Security chapter has 10 Commitments and dozens of measures. If resources are constrained, **these three create the foundation everything else builds on:**

1. **Commitment 1 (Safety & Security Framework)** — Without this, everything else is ad hoc. The Framework is the organisational backbone. It defines HOW you do risk management. Start here, even if the first version is imperfect — iterate.

2. **Commitment 2 + 3 (Risk Identification + Analysis)** — You cannot mitigate what you haven't identified. Run a structured risk identification workshop, develop scenarios, then analyse with evaluations (red-teaming, capability benchmarks). This produces the evidence base for everything downstream.

3. **Commitment 7 (Model Report)** — This is what the AI Office actually reads. It synthesises your Framework, risk assessment, and mitigations into a single document. Must be submitted before market placement. If enforcement begins and you don't have this, you're exposed.

**What can wait (briefly):** Commitments 8 (responsibility allocation) and 10 (additional documentation) are important but organisational — they formalise what should already be happening informally. Commitment 9 (incident reporting) needs a process, but the process can be lightweight initially and mature over time.

**What cannot wait:** Commitment 6 (security mitigations) — if your model weights can be stolen, nothing else matters. Ensure basic cybersecurity controls are in place from day one.

### For providers of systemic risk models:

1. **Assess current state** — map existing safety practices against all 10 Commitments
2. **Develop/update Safety & Security Framework** — the foundational document
3. **Conduct structured risk identification** — systematic, not ad hoc
4. **Run evaluations** — adversarial testing, capability evaluations, red-teaming
5. **Document risk acceptance decisions** — explicit criteria, documented reasoning
6. **Implement mitigations** — safety and security measures across the lifecycle
7. **Prepare Model Report** — comprehensive, before market placement
8. **Assign responsibilities** — clear RACI across the organisation
9. **Set up incident reporting** — processes, templates, escalation paths, deadlines
10. **Establish record-keeping** — 10-year retention for all safety activities

### Ongoing obligations:
- Post-market monitoring (continuous)
- Framework and Model Report updates (as conditions change)
- Incident tracking and reporting (ongoing)
- External evaluation engagement (periodic)
- Documentation maintenance (10-year rolling)
